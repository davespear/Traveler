This is a multi-phase project to create a app that will assist players (primarily game masters) for Traveller. I am starting with The New Era as that has a great deal of calculations and tables that need to used during gameplay. First phases will be functionality for Fire, Fusion and Steel then will move into the base rule book.

1. Get the app running with minimal frameworks. (Keep my raw skills active)
2. Go back and add React and maybe Angular to the UI. (Learn more about React and learn Angular compared to AngularJS)
3. Change to Blazor papes. (Improve skills with Blazor)
4. Migrate database to MS SQL for the backend. (Keep SQL skills up and improve skills with MS SQL in the process)
5. Build out the pipeline. (need more practice on this)
6. Maybe deploy some where for people to use.


Phase 1: Get the small arms functional
1. Get the backend of small arms ammunition working
2. Clean up frontend with style sheets (possibly React if I feel froggy)
3. Get small arms ammunition to save and display in list
4. Follow same process above for barrels, receivers, stocks, feed systems, and options

Phase 2: User authentication and security
1. Start on user authentication and security, need this asap but needed to be able to create an item to test #2 and #3 below
2. Verify any created small arms are visible only to the user that created it
3. Add functionality of groups owned by a user, which will allow group members to see items from #2, but not modify them

Phase 3: Starhips (go big!)
