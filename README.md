This is a multi-phase project to create a app that will assist players (primarily game masters) for Traveller. I am starting with The New Era as that has a great deal of calculates and tables that need to used during gameplay. 
1. Get the app running with minimal frameworks. (Keep my raw skills active)
2. Go back and add React and maybe Angular to the UI. (Learn more about React and learn Angular compared to AngularJS)
3. Change to Blazor papes. (Improve skills with Blazor)
4. Migrate database to MS SQL for the backend. (Keep SQL skills up and learn MS SQL in the process)
5. Build out the pipeline. (need more practice on this)
6. Maybe deploy some where for people to use.
